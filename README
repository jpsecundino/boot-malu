WHAT IT IS
-----------

  This is an exercise from our Operating Systems class, in which we should create 
 a bootloader template using Assembly x86. The template for this assignment can be
 found at https://github.com/monacofj/asm-bootloader-template

  The following source code is capable of, given a certain temperature value in Celsius,
 convert it to Fahrenheit and, following a table of parameters, recommend an outfit
 according to the weather provided.

WHAT YOU NEED
--------------

  You'll need a standard modern GNU/Linux platform with binutils, nasm,
 qemu, make and your preferred text editor.

  Read 'Makefile' for configuration directions.

BUILDING RULES
---------------

 At the terminal prompt, command

    $ make

 builds your MBR image (boot loader binary).

 You may test it using the x86 emulator by issuing

    $ make test

 In order to build a bootable ISO image for a USB memory stick, issue

    $ make iso

 and to test it, use

    $ make test-iso

 To copy the iso image to your physical USB memory stick, use

    $ make stick

 Other rules such as clean etc. work as usual.

TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------

  If you have problems booting your image with the emulator, make sure your
 image has the right size and boot signature. This is the main cause of
 booting failures.

  If you have problems booting your iso image through your USB stick, check
 your BIOS configuration settings, specially boot options. You may need to
 enable legacy BIOS support, or to disable security boot features.
